## By Mario Cabardo, Jeanne Castillo, Michael Douglas, and Noorulain Khaliq

## Description
Crossover is a collaborative storytelling application allowing users to create comic-book and graphic novel styled content alone and with friends.

Crossover was built entirely with React on the front-end, React-Konva to manage the state of the HTML5 canvas element, [Cloudinary APIâ€™s](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/solution_overview) to manipulate and store images, Google Cloud Firestore to store user data and references to images in Cloudinary, and we deployed the application with Google Firebase.

You can view the deployed app [here](https://crossover-cf663.firebaseapp.com/) and a presentation on it by the engineering team [here](https://goo.gl/yBrzhx)

Crossover was completed over 10 days as the Capstone Project to fulfill the graduation requirements of [Fullstack Academy](https://www.fullstackacademy.com/)
